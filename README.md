HR leaders must align HR data and initiatives to the organizationâ€™s strategic goals. For example, a tech company may want to improve collaboration across departments to increase the number of innovative ideas built into their software. HR initiatives like shared workspaces, company events, collaborative tools, and employee challenges can be implemented to achieve this goal. To determine how successful initiatives are, HR analytics can be utilized to examine correlations between initiatives and strategic goals.

Once data is gathered, HR analysts feed workforce data into sophisticated data models, algorithms, and tools to gain actionable insights. These tools provide insights in the form of dashboards, visualizations, and reports. An ongoing process should be put in place to ensure continued improvement:
